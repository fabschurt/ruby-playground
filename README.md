# My little Ruby playground

[![CI](https://github.com/fabschurt/ruby-playground/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fabschurt/ruby-playground/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is a collection of experiments with some Ruby features: the funky ones, the lesser-known ones, and the
“hard-to-remember-by-my-clumsy-brain” ones. Behavior is verified through simple
[minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest) specs.

(Ruby 3.0+ required.)
